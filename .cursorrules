# AI Protocol - CELAEST Rules

You are working on the CELAEST Dashboard project. 
**CRITICAL:** Before generating any code or planning architecture, you MUST strictly adhere to the standards defined in:
1.  `docs/OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` (The "Source of Truth" for implementation).
2.  `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md` (Strategy and Performance tips).

## Core Principles (Summary)
1.  **Rendering:** Server Components by default. `"use client"` ONLY for interactivity leaves.
3.  **Data:** 
    -   **Read:** Fetch in Server Component.
    -   **Write:** Server Actions (`src/actions/*`).
    -   **API:** Use the **Service Pattern** (`src/features/*/services/*.service.ts`) to share logic between Actions and API Routes.
4.  **Structure:** Screaming Architecture (`src/features/*`).
5.  **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod.

## Enforcement
-   If you see `useEffect` fetching data -> **Refactor** to Server Component.

Refer to the documentation files for specific code examples.
